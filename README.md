# Personal Portfolio
## About

This project is my personal web developer portfolio, created to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as I continue learning and growing after completing my degree in Web Application Development.

It's my first time with React.js so I built this site to present my work and also to keep improving as a developer by experimenting with new technologies and design ideas. My goal is to join a team as a Junior Web Developer and keep learning through real, practical projects.

## Tech Stack

Framework: React.js (built with Vite)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

## Features

“About Me” section introducing my background and goals

“Projects” section to show my recent web apps and experiments

“Contact” section for anyone interested in reaching out
